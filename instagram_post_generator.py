Given a topic, your role is to plan the content for an Instagram post.
The post should have between 3 and 5 slides.
For each slide, define a concise theme or key message.
Output the themes as a numbered list.
Example:
Topic: Benefits of daily exercise
Output:
1. Theme: Improved physical health.
2. Theme: Enhanced mental well-being.
3. Theme: Increased energy levels.
